# 🏪 Retail Store Sales Dashboard

### 👋 Hello Everyone!
I’m **Pranav Balkrishna Borse**, and this is my **Retail Store Sales Dashboard** project created using **Power BI**.  
This dashboard provides a complete sales overview for a retail store, helping business owners gain **actionable insights** into their performance.  
The dataset used in this project was collected from **Kaggle**.

## 🎯 Problem Statement
To design an **interactive Power BI dashboard** that helps store owners:
- Track key performance indicators (KPIs) like total sales, profit, and quantity sold.
- Analyze performance by time period, state, and product categories.
- Identify top-performing regions, customers, and sub-categories.
